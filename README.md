## Building the 'rwd.education' site

You can browse the source files used to build the [rwd.education](https://rwd.education) website here.

To build the site I used a little Gulp build script to speed development.

**Note** that a CSS pre-processor step was used so I can nest media queries inside selectors and TypeScript was used for the little bit of JavaScript I needed because I prefer writing ES6 syntax and TypeScript converts it into more widely supported syntax.

I also used the rather lovely [https://realfavicongenerator.net/](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to make all the favicon images/manifests.

If you are curious and 'don't mind getting your hands dirty', included in the folder should be everything you need to run it up in a local server yourself.

-   You will need to install a recent version of Node (I used 14 if memory serves)
-   You will need to install [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com) v4 CLI
-   Run <code>[sudo] npm install</code> in Terminal from the 'rwd.education' folder
-   Assuming all installs OK (cross all your digits!), after everything is installed, you should now be able to run 'gulp' from the Terminal and away you go.
