    <p>
      If you can keep your head when all about you<br />
      Are losing theirs and blaming it on you; <br />If you can trust yourself
      when all men doubt you,<br />
      But make allowance for their doubting too:<br />If you can wait and not be
      tired by waiting,<br />
      Or, being lied about, don't deal in lies,<br />Or being hated don't give
      way to hating,<br />
      And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise; <br />
      <br />If you can dream- -and not make dreams your master; <br />
      If you can think- -and not make thoughts your aim,<br />If you can meet
      with Triumph and Disaster<br />
      And treat those two impostors just the same:.<br />If you can bear to hear
      the truth you've spoken<br />
      Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br />Or watch the things you
      gave your life to, broken,<br />
      And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools; <br />
      <br />If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br />
      And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br />And lose, and start again
      at your beginnings,<br />
      And never breathe a word about your loss:<br />If you can force your heart
      and nerve and sinew<br />
      To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br />And so hold on when
      there is nothing in you<br />
      Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on! '<br />
      <br />If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br />
      Or walk with Kings- -nor lose the common touch,<br />If neither foes nor
      loving friends can hurt you,<br />
      If all men count with you, but none too much:<br />If you can fill the
      unforgiving minute<br />
      With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,<br />Yours is the Earth and
      everything that's in it,<br />
      And- -which is more- -you'll be a Man, my son!
      <br />
