    <p style="width: 40%;"> The first part of this cafe style coffee recipe is beating the coffee with a spoon briskly and vigorously. Hence this coffee is also called as beaten coffee. In many Indian homes, including mine, beaten coffee is made. Here the coffee is beaten with milk till its frothy.

        In India we call coffee made with this method as beaten coffee. though in my home, we are mostly tea drinkers, but beaten coffee is made at times. I will also share the method of making Indian beaten coffee in some time.
